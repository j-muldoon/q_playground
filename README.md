# Q Playground

This is where I will be storing test projects as I learn the kdb+/q programming language.

Some links I have found helpful:

- [Link to intro to kdb+ and q YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eoysfqO3UY&list=PLypX5sYuDqvrwBD2EMWadIMiTqJZmVsqm).
- [Link to Q for Mortals book](https://code.kx.com/q4m3/).
- [Link to KX documentation for kdb+](https://code.kx.com/q/).
